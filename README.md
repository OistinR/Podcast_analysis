# Podcast_analysis

# Goal:
I want to extract insights from a podcast discussion, such as who is talking the most? who is using the most swear words? when the podcast has male guests do they talk more than female guests? I want to examine the data and learn more about docker, python and the related tools. 


In this project I intent to create a pipline which uses models to extract data from podcasts. 
The data I want to extract is the transcript. I want to also know who is speaking.
